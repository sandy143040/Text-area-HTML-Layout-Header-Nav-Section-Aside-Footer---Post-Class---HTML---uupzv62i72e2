# PARALLAX WEBPAGE


  This is a complete HTML CSS based Mini Project on "PARALLAX WEBSITE".


## Features
   A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that
   is kept in the place and user can scroll down the page to see the 
   different parts of the image. In this article, creating a parallax 
   webpage using HTML and CSS. I used the tags of HTML like div, span, paragraph, and heading to write our content and use CSS to allign and beautify our basic HTML design.

####  Why is parallax scrolling important?
- With parallax scrolling, you put your visitors in charge.
   By doing so, they take in an active role in their interaction 
   with your site. This active role gives people the impression that
   they choose to engage with your site, making them more positive and
   more open for your message.
   

## Approach:
- I have used container element and add a background image to the container.
  Then i have used background-attachment:fixed to create the actual parallax effect.
  
- For each HTML section we have given a class so that it can be target in the CSS.

- In the HTML page, i have decorated our text, and placed the head at a fixed position.
